# majormemoryapp
An app to learn the major memory system and practice it.
The Major Memory sytem is a memory system to easily learn numbers.
This app helps a person to easily learn the number - image links.
An image appears and a person must click on the corresponding image. 
If it is correct then the image will disappear.
If it is wrong then a warning is given.
The app can also record the time taken to work through the images and it will record the average time taken between images.
Any images that were incorrectly clicked will be displayed for further revision.

Any contribution to this project will be highly appreciate.

Thank you in advance.
